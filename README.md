# Fraud Detection Pipeline Using Kafka and Machine Learning

This project implements a real-time fraud detection pipeline using Apache Kafka, machine learning, and MySQL. The goal of this project is to monitor transactions and predict whether they are fraudulent using a machine learning model. The pipeline is built to process streaming data from Kafka, apply preprocessing and transformations, and then use a trained Random Forest model to classify transactions as fraudulent or not. The results are stored in a MySQL database for further analysis.

## Overview

In this project, Iâ€™ve built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fraud in real-time using Kafka for stream processing and MySQL for storing results. The pipeline receives incoming transaction data, processes it using feature engineering techniques, predicts fraud using a trained machine learning model, and stores the results in a database.

The core components of the pipeline include:
1. **Kafka Producer**: Simulates a stream of transaction data.
2. **Kafka Consumer**: Reads the incoming transaction data and processes it.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature engineering and scaling of data.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict fraudulent transactions.
5. **MySQL Database**: Stores the results of the fraud detection predictions.

## Features

- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Utilizes Kafka for real-time message streaming and a Random Forest classifier for fraud prediction.
- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Kafka consumes streaming transaction data and applies the model automatically.
- **Data Storage**: The predicted fraud results are stored in MySQL for future analysis.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Kafka allows for handling large volumes of transaction data in a distributed system.
- **Model Training**: The Random Forest model is trained on historical data and predicts the likelihood of fraud in transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming and message consumption.
- **Python**: For implementing the data processing pipeline and machine learning model.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **imblearn (SMOTE)**: For handling class imbalance during training.
- **MySQL**: For storing transaction data and fraud predictions.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **geopy**: For calculating distances between locations as a feature in the model.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used as the predictive model for fraud detection.
